# Contributing Guide {#contributingguide}

So you want to contribute to rOpenSci packages? Fantastic! First of all, maybe contributing to a package is not the (only) way you'll want to get involved with rOpenSci. Check out our [community page](https://ropensci.org/community/) to find out all the ways to participate in the project.

Thanks for wanting to contribute to rOpenSci packages. We strive to make contributing to our suite a constructive and positive experience. See [our code of conduct](https://ropensci.org/coc/). Regarding this guide itself, please report any suggestion via [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/ropensci/dev_guide).

## Pre-requisities

Before contributing to one of our packages, you might want to read a bit more about package development in general and our guidelines.

### Learning about package development

#### Tutorials

### Reading about our guidelines

See the whole first section, starting with the [chapter about building a package](#building)

## Reporting issues or feature requests

If you already have a package in mind, head to its issue tracker for reporting a bug or a feature request you might have. E.g. if you have a feature request for `magick`, the place to fill it is https://github.com/ropensci/magick/issues

## Finding where to contribute code or documentation

Most our packages are developped on GitHub. We have two organizations:

* https://github.com/ropensci for more mature packages,

* https://github.com/ropenscilabs for experiments and packages that are not ready for release yet.

If you already use one of our packages, you can have a look at its issue tracker and comment in one of the issues to ask the maintainer whether they'd be interested in your help. E.g. if you like `taxize`, the place to look is https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/issues

If you're not a passionate user of one of our packages yet, you can find one to contribute to by browsing https://github.com/ropensci for instance. In particular, you could browse issues targeted at beginner by using [the `contributr` Shiny app by Lucy D'Agostino McGowan](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aropensci+user%3Aropenscilabs+label%3ABeginner+state%3Aopen&type=Issues)
 or by an advanced GitHub search such as [this one](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aropensci+user%3Aropenscilabs+label%3ABeginner+state%3Aopen&type=Issues).

# Preface {-}

This book has the ambition to become a guide for maintainers of rOpenSci packages, in particular volunteers who submit a package to onboarding. 

The [first section of the book](#building) presents our guidelines for building and testing your package. 

The second section is dedicated to onboarding: what it is, our policies, and specific guides for authors, editors and reviewers.

The third and last section features our best practice for nurturing your package once it has been onboarded: how to collaborate with other developers, how to document releases, how to promote your package and how to leverage GitHub as a development platform.

We hope that you'll find the guide useful and clear, and welcome your suggestions in the [issue tracker of the book](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/dev_guide/issues). Happy R packaging!

The rOpenSci editorial team.

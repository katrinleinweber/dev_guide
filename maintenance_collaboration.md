#  (PART) Maintaining Packages {-}

# Collaboration Guide

Having contributors will improve your package, and if you onboard some of them as package authors with push right to the repo, your package will be more sustainably developed.

## Make your repo contribution- and collaboration- friendly

### Code of conduct

We require that you use a code of conduct such as the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) in developing your package.  You can document your code of conduct in a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` or `CONDUCT.md` file in the package root directory, and linking to this file from the `README.md` file.  `devtools::use_code_of_conduct()` will add the Contributor Covenant template to your package.

### Contributing guide

Please include contribution guidelines in the README or CONTRIBUTING.

### Issue labelling

You can use labels such as "help wanted" and "good first issue" to help potential collaborators, including newbies, find your repo. [Cf GitHub article](https://help.github.com/articles/helping-new-contributors-find-your-project-with-labels/)

## Working with collaborators

### Assessing a PR

Cf ["Explore and extend a pull request" in happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/pr-extend.html)

### Be generous with attributions

If someone contributes to your repository consider adding them in DESCRIPTION, as contributor ("ctb") for small contributions, author ("aut") for bigger contributions. Also consider adding their name near the feature/bug fix line in [NEWS.md](#news) We recommend your being generous with such acknowledgements.

### Onboarding collaborators

If you give someone access to the repository, please contact one of [the editors](#associateditors) or [Stefanie Butland](github.com/stefaniebutland) so that they might get invited to rOpenSci slack workspace.

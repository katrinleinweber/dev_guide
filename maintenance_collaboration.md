## Code of Conduct

* We recommend that you use a code of conduct such as the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) in developing your package.  You can document your code of conduct in a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` or `CONDUCT.md` file in the package root directory, and linking to this file from the `README.md` file.  `devtools::use_code_of_conduct()` will add the Contributor Covenant template to your package.
